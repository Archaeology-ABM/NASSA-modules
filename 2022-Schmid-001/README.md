# Module name or title

*by FULLNAME* (NASSA submission :rocket:)

Description of what the module does. It should expand the information already given in the name/title.

## License

Add any default short text about license here, if license recommends it or offers badges. For example, if using the MIT License, naming it directly will be enough as long as the `LICENSE` file is present:

**MIT**

## References

Use a print out version of the references in `references.bib` (any bibliographic convention). Supress section if there are no references. For example, using APA 7th edition style:

Epstein, J. M. (2008). Why Model? Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation, 11(4), 12.

Romanowska, I. (2021). Agent-Based Modeling for Archaeology (Electronic). SFI Press. https://doi.org/10.37911/9781947864382

## Further information

Add as many design details, instructions, and demonstrations as possible, particularly information that is not included in `NASSA.yml`. If the information is included as markdown or html files in the documentation folder, add links to them here (if they are absolute URLs inside the module directory, remember to update them once the module is integrated to the library).

See full list of documentation resources in [`documentation`](documentation/tableOfContents.md).

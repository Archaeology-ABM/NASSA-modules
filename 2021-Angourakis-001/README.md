# Angle-and-step random walk
*by Andreas Angourakis* (NASSA submission :rocket:)

An Python implementation of random walk in 2D space based on agent angle orientation and step distance. It defines an agent class `Walker` capable of random walk movement based on random angle and movement step distance in a continuous 2D space.

description: >
    This NetLogo algorithm generates a landscape composed of user-defined landscape types arranged in concentric rings. 
  It can optionally place settlements on landscape types deemed suitable by the user. 
  The algorithm also assigns land cover types to patches either randomly or via a contiguous growth process.

inputs:
  - name: min-patch-xcor, min-patch-ycor, max-patch-xcor, max-patch-ycor
    type: integers
    unit: no specific unit
    description: >
     Represents the numeric boundaries of the NetLogo world in terms of patch coordinates (i.e., the lower-left and upper-right corners of the grid).
  - name: patch-pixel-size
    type: integer
    unit: no specific unit
    description: >
    Controls the visual resolution of the NetLogo view. A larger patch-pixel-size makes each patch look bigger on screen but does not change the underlying model resolution or patch count.
  - name: max-settlements
    type: integer
    unit: no specific unit
    description: >
    Maximum number of settlements to be placed on the landscape.
  - name: max-households-per-settlement
    type: integer 
    unit: no specific unit
    description: >
    Maximum number of households that can be assigned to each individual settlement.
  - name: landscape-types
    type: list of lists (integer, string, float, string)
    unit: no specific unit
    description: >
     List of landscape types defined as nested lists. Each list contains: 
      an ID (integer), landscape name (string), proportion of total land (float between 0â€“1), and color (string or integer).
      Landscape types should be ordered from central to outermost.
  - name: valid-landscape-types
    type: list of strings
    unit: no specific unit
    description: >
    List of landscape type names (strings) where settlements are allowed to be placed. 
      These must match the names defined in `landscape-types`.

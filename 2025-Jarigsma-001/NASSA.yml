description: >
    This NetLogo algorithm generates a landscape composed of user-defined landscape types arranged in concentric rings. 
  It can optionally place settlements on landscape types deemed suitable by the user. 
  The algorithm also assigns land cover types to patches either randomly or via a contiguous growth process.

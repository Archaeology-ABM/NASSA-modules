# Landscape and Land Cover Generation with Contiguous Growth
*by Amber Esha Jarigsma*  

This algorithm simulates a simplified settlement-landscape interaction where users can easily define different landscape types, land covers, and rules for settlement placement in the setup procedure. 
It is designed to allow flexible configuration of environmental and social parameters. Landscapes are arranged in contiguous zones.

## Further information
This model is an algorithm implemented in NetLogo. 

Landcover generation is user-configurable, supporting both stochastic dispersion (Figure 1) and seed-initiatied contiguous expansion (Figure 2) to accomodate varied modeling requirements.

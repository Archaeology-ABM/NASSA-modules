TroyDestroy (DUMMY EXAMPLE)
# Instructions

## Version without agents

1. Select input values in the interface:
   1. `par_greeks-strength`, `par_trojans-strength`: the strength of the contending armies (if could represent number of soldiers, units, etc). The interface sliders allow for 0 to 100, but this is not required by design.
   2. `par_destruction-rate`: this is a multiplier rate expressing how many much attackers strength, weighted in relation to the defenders strength, is necessary to decrease one unit of the city health.
2. Press "setup". Observe that a default value for `troy-health` is assigned in code (`init-troy-health`).
3. Press "resolve-trojan-war".
4. Observe change in `troy-health`

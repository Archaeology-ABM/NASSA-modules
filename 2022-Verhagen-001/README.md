## Further information

This NetLogo code snippet provides fertility estimates of females for use in demographic simulations. The figures used are based on two different sources, one for Roman Egypt and one for modern populations, and will be assigned per 5-year age cohort.

The code snippet is a procedure that can be inserted into a NetLogo model and will not run independently.

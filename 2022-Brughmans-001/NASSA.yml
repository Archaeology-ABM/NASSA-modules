  A draft model with some useful code for creating different network structures using the Netlogo NW extension: small-world, preferential attachment, circular, star, wheel, lattice, random, nearest neighbours. This model is used for the following tutorial: Brughmans, T. (2018). Network structures and assembling code in Netlogo, Tutorial, https://archaeologicalnetworks.wordpress.com/resources/#structures .
